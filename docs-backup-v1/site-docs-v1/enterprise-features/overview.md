# Enterprise Features

AI Fabrix is designed for enterprises that need **more than raw AI infrastructure**. While Microsoft provides the foundation—Azure, Entra ID, and AI services—Fabrix adds the **enterprise layer** that ensures AI adoption is **secure, governed, and scalable**.

This section explains the enterprise-grade features that distinguish Fabrix from generic AI platforms. Together, they form the control and compliance framework needed to deploy AI at scale in regulated industries.

## Why Enterprise Features Matter

Many AI pilots succeed technically but fail to reach production because of gaps in:

- **Identity integration** — AI must follow the same SSO, RBAC, and SCIM standards as other enterprise systems.
- **Governance** — administrators need guardrails for usage, cost, and data flows.
- **Compliance** — regulated industries require evidence-ready audits and security controls.
- **Scalability** — enterprises need controlled Dev→Test→Prod lifecycles and multi-region resilience.

Fabrix closes these gaps by embedding these capabilities into its **Miso control layer** and **core platform services**.

## What You'll Find in This Section

1. **Identity & Access Management** — How Fabrix integrates with Entra ID and SCIM for seamless user and role control.
2. **Governance & Policy Packs** — How administrators enforce policies, quotas, and egress controls with audit-ready governance.
3. **Compliance & Auditability** — How Fabrix delivers compliance-by-default with ISO-27001 alignment, audit trails, and secure patterns.
4. **Scalability & Observability** — How enterprises achieve Dev→Test→Prod pipelines, resilient scaling, and cost telemetry.

## Key Message

Fabrix is not just another AI toolkit. It is an **enterprise AI fabric**, layered on top of Microsoft's foundation, that ensures **identity, governance, compliance, and scalability** are built in from day one. This makes AI adoption safe, sustainable, and enterprise-ready.
