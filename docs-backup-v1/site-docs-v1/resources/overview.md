# Resources — Overview

The **Resources** section provides the supporting material enterprises need to successfully evaluate, deploy, and operate **AI Fabrix**.
While the core documentation explains the *what* and *why*, these resources focus on the *how* — delivering templates, diagrams, and starter kits that accelerate adoption without compromising governance or compliance.

## Table of Contents

1. [Architecture Diagrams](architecture-diagrams.md)
2. [Evaluation Workbook](evaluation-workbook.md)
3. [RFP/RFI Templates](rfp-rfi-templates.md)
4. [SDK & Plugin Starters](sdk-plugin-starters.md)
5. [Release Notes & Changelogs](release-notes-changelogs.md)

---

## Why Resources Matter

Enterprises adopting AI platforms often face three challenges:

1. **Complex evaluation cycles** — CIOs and architects require structured tools to compare vendors and assess compliance.
2. **Deployment clarity** — IT teams need reference architectures and sizing guides to align with Azure best practices.
3. **Developer enablement** — Extending Fabrix with connectors or plugins requires secure, well-documented starting points.

The resources in this section address all three, ensuring Fabrix deployments move quickly from **pilot to production** with full enterprise guardrails.

---

## What's Included

This section includes:

- **Architecture Diagrams** — Azure reference models, governance flows, and retrieval pipelines.
- **Evaluation Workbook** — 30-day PoC guidance with security, cost, and success scoring tools.
- **RFP/RFI Templates** — Ready-made procurement documents for fair vendor evaluation.
- **SDK & Plugin Starters** — Developer kits for extending Fabrix with enterprise-safe connectors.
- **Release Notes & Changelogs** — Transparent tracking of new features, fixes, and roadmap progress.

---

## Audience

These resources are designed for:

- **Executives & IT Managers** — decision support and procurement templates.
- **Enterprise Architects** — technical diagrams and compliance checklists.
- **Developers & Engineers** — SDKs, plugin samples, and extension frameworks.

---

## Next Steps

Each sub-page provides direct access to materials, with placeholders for downloadable files and repositories.
Together, they form a **practical toolkit** to accelerate Fabrix adoption while ensuring **security, compliance, and predictable operations**.
