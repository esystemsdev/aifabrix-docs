# Roadmap

AI Fabrix is not a static platform—it is continuously evolving to meet the **enterprise priorities of security, compliance, governance, and scalability**.
This section provides an overview of the roadmap, outlining near-term feature expansions, mid-term architectural extensions, and long-term strategic directions.

The roadmap ensures that customers have **clear visibility** into where Fabrix is heading, helping CIOs, IT managers, and enterprise architects plan AI adoption with confidence.

3. [Expanded Compliance & Observability](expanded-compliance-observability.md)

## Strategic Direction

Fabrix development is guided by four core enterprise drivers:

- **In-Tenant First** – keep deployments secure and private by default.
- **Governance & Policy Control** – extend policy packs, audits, and usage guardrails.
- **Enterprise Integration** – broaden connectors and SDK capabilities for business systems.
- **Predictable Economics** – provide cost forecasting and scalable subscription tiers.

This ensures Fabrix continues to serve as a **trusted AI foundation** inside Microsoft Azure, while steadily expanding reach and functionality.

## What's Next

- **Upcoming Features:** Expansion of connectors, SDK improvements, and governance packs.
- **Multi-Cloud & Hybrid:** Support for distributed and regulated environments.
- **Compliance & Observability:** Stronger reporting, evidence generation, and forecasting tools.
