# Case Studies

AI Fabrix is designed to solve real enterprise challenges where compliance, governance, and cost predictability are critical. Case studies demonstrate how organizations across industries adopt Fabrix to move beyond AI experimentation and achieve measurable business outcomes.

## Case Study Framework

Each case study follows a clear and repeatable structure:

- **Problem** — What was blocking AI adoption?
- **Solution** — How Fabrix was deployed inside the enterprise tenant.
- **Outcome** — What measurable improvements were achieved.

---

## Example Patterns

### Case Study A: Financial Services

- **Problem:** Multiple AI pilots running in silos, with compliance teams rejecting production rollout due to data residency and audit risks.
- **Solution:** Deploy Fabrix in-tenant with **Miso governance**, Entra ID–based identity, and metadata-aware retrieval from SharePoint and Teams.
- **Outcome:** First compliant knowledge assistant launched in under 90 days; clear audit trails enabled regulator approval.

### Case Study B: Manufacturing

- **Problem:** Engineering and operations data spread across SharePoint, ERP, and file systems with no unified retrieval.
- **Solution:** Fabrix connectors integrated these sources into a governed RAG pipeline, ensuring only permissioned access.
- **Outcome:** Reduced time to locate critical maintenance documentation from hours to minutes, with measurable productivity gains.

### Case Study C: Public Sector

- **Problem:** High security requirements prevented use of external SaaS AI platforms.
- **Solution:** Fabrix deployed inside Azure tenant with private networking, Key Vault–only secrets, and audit-by-default.
- **Outcome:** Enabled secure AI use cases such as citizen support assistants and policy-aware knowledge retrieval.

## Value Demonstrated

Across these examples, common benefits emerge:

- **Compliance confidence** — Policy-aware AI that regulators and auditors can approve.
- **Faster time-to-value** — Pilots moved to production in weeks, not years.
- **Predictable economics** — Clear subscription tiers and Azure-billed infrastructure.
- **User adoption** — Knowledge assistants integrated with Microsoft 365 tools (Teams, SharePoint) for seamless use.

## Next Steps

[[PLACEHOLDER: Add customer-specific case examples with logos, metrics, and quotes once available.]]

This library of case studies will grow as more enterprises scale Fabrix into production.
