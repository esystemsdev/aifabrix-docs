# ROI & KPI Library

Adopting AI at enterprise scale requires clear evidence of value. AI Fabrix provides a structured **ROI & KPI framework** that enables organizations to measure progress, demonstrate outcomes, and align AI adoption with business strategy.

## Why KPIs Matter

Many AI pilots fail because success is not defined upfront. Fabrix addresses this by embedding governance, observability, and cost tracking into the platform, allowing enterprises to measure:

- **Business impact** — How AI reduces time, errors, or costs.
- **Adoption** — How widely and consistently AI is used across the enterprise.
- **Compliance** — How well AI usage aligns with policies, regulations, and audits.
- **Economics** — Whether spend aligns with projected budgets.

## KPI Categories

### 1. Time to Production

- **Definition:** Average time to promote a proof-of-concept (PoC) into production.
- **Why it matters:** Shorter cycles reduce innovation risk and accelerate ROI.
- **Example metric:** PoC-to-production in <90 days.

### 2. Compliance Coverage

- **Definition:** Percentage of AI workflows governed by policy packs and audit logging.
- **Why it matters:** Ensures all deployments meet enterprise and regulatory standards.
- **Example metric:** 100% of agents with active audit trails.

### 3. Adoption Metrics

- **Definition:** Measurement of user and system adoption.
- **Why it matters:** Demonstrates real business uptake, not just technical feasibility.
- **Example metrics:**

  - Number of active users per month.
  - Number of connectors integrated.
  - Number of governed AI agents in operation.

### 4. Cost Predictability

- **Definition:** Alignment of actual Azure + Fabrix subscription spend with projected budgets.
- **Why it matters:** Prevents hidden costs that often derail AI programs.
- **Example metric:** Variance between projected vs. actual spend ≤10%.

## ROI Dimensions

Fabrix enables enterprises to report ROI in multiple dimensions:

- **Productivity Gains:** Time saved per employee on knowledge retrieval or document preparation.
- **Compliance Savings:** Reduced effort for audit, risk reporting, and regulator approval.
- **IT Efficiency:** Centralized platform reduces integration complexity and duplicate spend.
- **Innovation Velocity:** Faster experimentation cycles without sacrificing governance.
