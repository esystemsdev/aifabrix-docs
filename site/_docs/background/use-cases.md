## Document Processing

Automate ingestion, classification, extraction, and compliance handling for unstructured content.

* **Ingestion & Normalisation**
  Bulk ingest from SharePoint libraries and email drops; auto-enrichment with business metadata and lineage.

* **Classification & PII/PHI Redaction**
  Policy-driven redaction and tagging; route sensitive items to controlled processing paths.

* **Extraction & Validation**
  Structured data extraction (invoices, contracts, SOPs), schema validation, exception handling queues.

* **Retention & Audit**
  Lifecycle policies, immutable logs, and evidence packs for audits.

**Typical outcomes**: 60–85% cycle-time reduction, 30–50% lower manual QA effort, faster audit readiness.

## Workflow Automation

Bridge people, AI, and systems with resilient, auditable workflows.

* **Human-in/on-the-loop**
  Approval steps, escalation paths, and rollback safeguards for sensitive actions.

* **Cross-App Orchestration**
  Multi-system workflows (e.g., CRM ↔ ERP ↔ Finance) with idempotency, retries, and compensation logic.

* **Policy-Driven Automation**
  Enforce data residency, least privilege, and change-control gates in the pipeline.

* **Observability & SLOs**
  Metrics, traces, and alerts for throughput, error budgets, and business KPIs.

---

## Integration Scenarios

Pre-built patterns to de-risk integration and reduce hidden project costs.

* **SharePoint/Teams Knowledge Fabric**
