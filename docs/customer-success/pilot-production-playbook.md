# Pilot → Production Playbook

Enterprises often succeed with AI pilots but struggle to scale them into production. AI Fabrix provides a **structured playbook** to move from small experiments to enterprise-grade adoption — without losing compliance, cost control, or governance.

## Phase 1: Pilot Setup

- Deploy Fabrix in a **controlled environment** (single department or use case).
- Focus on one high-value but contained scenario (e.g., internal knowledge assistant).
- Enable **Miso control layer** from day one to ensure governance and audit coverage.

---

## Phase 2: Validation

- Define and track KPIs from the **ROI & KPI Library** (time-to-production, adoption, compliance coverage).
- Validate that connectors (e.g., SharePoint, Teams, CRM) operate with **metadata-aware retrieval**.
- Confirm cost alignment with projected budgets to prevent scaling surprises.

---

## Phase 3: Expansion

- Extend Fabrix to additional departments or workflows.
- Reuse governance and policy packs to ensure **consistent compliance**.
- Add more connectors and metadata enrichment as new systems are brought in.
- Train adoption champions within business units to accelerate uptake.

---

## Phase 4: Enterprise Production

- Transition to multi-region scaling using **Azure Front Door** and autoscaling infrastructure.
- Promote environments **Dev → Test → Prod** under Miso policy-as-code.
- Enable **observability and cost telemetry** to ensure long-term sustainability.
- Support large-scale user adoption through integration with **Teams or Slack** as chat interfaces.

---

## Key Success Factors

- **Governance-first:** Start with compliance and policy packs during pilots — don't retrofit later.
- **Measurable outcomes:** Track KPIs consistently at every stage.
- **Scalable foundation:** Use the same in-tenant deployment model from pilot to production.
- **Predictable economics:** Keep spend tied to subscription tier + Azure billing.
