## Case Study Framework

Each case study follows a clear and repeatable structure:

- **Problem** — What was blocking AI adoption?
- **Solution** — How Fabrix was deployed inside the enterprise tenant.
- **Outcome** — What measurable improvements were achieved.

---

## Example Patterns

### Case Study A: Financial Services

- **Problem:** Multiple AI pilots running in silos, with compliance teams rejecting production rollout due to data residency and audit risks.
- **Solution:** Deploy Fabrix in-tenant with **Miso governance**, Entra ID–based identity, and metadata-aware retrieval from SharePoint and Teams.
- **Outcome:** First compliant knowledge assistant launched in under 90 days; clear audit trails enabled regulator approval.

### Case Study B: Manufacturing

- **Problem:** Engineering and operations data spread across SharePoint, ERP, and file systems with no unified retrieval.
- **Solution:** Fabrix connectors integrated these sources into a governed RAG pipeline, ensuring only permissioned access.
- **Outcome:** Reduced time to locate critical maintenance documentation from hours to minutes, with measurable productivity gains.

### Case Study C: Public Sector

- **Problem:** High security requirements prevented use of external SaaS AI platforms.
- **Solution:** Fabrix deployed inside Azure tenant with private networking, Key Vault–only secrets, and audit-by-default.
- **Outcome:** Enabled secure AI use cases such as citizen support assistants and policy-aware knowledge retrieval.

## Value Demonstrated

Across these examples, common benefits emerge:

- **Compliance confidence** — Policy-aware AI that regulators and auditors can approve.
- **Faster time-to-value** — Pilots moved to production in weeks, not years.
- **Predictable economics** — Clear subscription tiers and Azure-billed infrastructure.
- **User adoption** — Knowledge assistants integrated with Microsoft 365 tools (Teams, SharePoint) for seamless use.
