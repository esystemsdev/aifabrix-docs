## Why Customer Success Matters

Many enterprises struggle with AI adoption because:

- Pilots remain disconnected from production systems.
- Compliance and governance requirements block scaling.
- Costs spiral due to hidden integration and infrastructure overhead.

Fabrix addresses these challenges by embedding AI directly inside the enterprise Azure tenant, with governance, observability, and cost controls built in.
