# Infrastructure Sizing & Scaling

AI Fabrix is designed to scale **predictably** inside the customer's Azure tenant.
Every deployment uses Azure-native resources, with defined **size presets (S, M, L, XL)** to align infrastructure with expected workloads and compliance needs.

This approach ensures that scaling is transparent, cost-predictable, and managed entirely within the customer's Azure subscription.

## Sizing Profiles

Each subscription is deployed with a **size preset** that determines the underlying Azure services for compute, database, caching, storage, and networking.

| Size   | App Service / Container Plan                          | PostgreSQL (pgvector)   | Redis Cache       | Storage | Networking                                                          | Intended Use                            |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **S**  | Basic App Service Plan / Small Container              | Single-node, ~50 GB     | Basic (1 GB)      | 100 GB  | VNet + Private Endpoints                                            | Sandbox / Development                   |
| **M**  | Standard App Service Plan                             | HA-enabled, ~200 GB     | Standard (2–5 GB) | 500 GB  | VNet + Private Endpoints                                            | SMB / Department scale                  |
| **L**  | Premium App Service Plan                              | HA-enabled, ~500 GB     | Premium (10 GB)   | 1 TB    | VNet + Private Endpoints                                            | Enterprise scale                        |
| **XL** | Premium/Isolated Plan with dedicated vNET integration | Large HA-enabled, >1 TB | Premium (>20 GB)  | 5 TB+   | VNet + Private Endpoints + Global Load Balancing (Azure Front Door) | Global deployments, regulated workloads |

⚠️ Exact Azure SKUs may vary depending on **regional availability** and **customer preferences**.
All infrastructure costs are billed directly to the customer's Azure subscription for **full transparency**.

## Scaling Approach

Fabrix uses Azure-native scaling options to adapt to enterprise workloads:

- **Horizontal scaling** — Container workloads and App Services autoscale based on demand.
- **Vertical scaling** — Upgrade from S → M → L → XL by adjusting Azure service plans.
- **Multi-region distribution** — Enabled with **Azure Front Door** for global, low-latency deployments.
- **Environment lifecycle** — Dev → Test → Prod separation ensures controlled promotion.
- **Rollback support** — Application containers can revert to a known-good state.

## Upgrade Path

- **Subscription Upgrades**: Move from Community → Standard → Enterprise without redeploying infrastructure; features unlock via license.
- **Size Upgrades**: Move between S, M, L, XL with **seamless migration**; no architectural redesign required.

## Observability & Cost Control

Fabrix adds governance and visibility on top of Azure monitoring:

- **Telemetry**: Metrics, structured logs, traces, and health endpoints.
- **Cost Transparency**: Direct Azure billing, no hidden SaaS fees.
- **Quotas & Policies**: Administrators can set usage and cost limits at the Miso control layer.

## Key Takeaway

Fabrix infrastructure sizing makes it easy to start small, grow to enterprise production, and scale globally — all while staying inside the same **Azure-native architecture**.
