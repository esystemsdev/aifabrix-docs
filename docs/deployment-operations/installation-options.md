# Installation Options

AI Fabrix provides a **guided, two-stage deployment model** that balances simplicity with enterprise control.
All deployments run inside the customer's Azure tenant, with resources secured through **private networking, Azure Key Vault, and Entra ID** integration.

## Stage 1: Minimal Deployment (Installer + Miso Bootstrap)

The first step installs a **lightweight Fabrix installer** and a minimal Miso controller.
This bootstrap environment establishes the secure foundation, including:

- Networking (VNet, private endpoints, DNS)
- Secrets management (Azure Key Vault)
- Authentication (Entra ID SSO)
- Access to the enterprise management interface

This provides a ready entry point for managing subsequent deployments.

## Stage 2: Full Miso Controller Environment

The second step upgrades to the **full Miso controller**, enabling:

- Governance and policy packs
- Centralized monitoring and audit trails
- Role-based access and SCIM provisioning
- Application container orchestration with rollback support

From here, enterprises manage **applications, connectors, and RAG pipelines** centrally, without manual configuration.

## Environment Deployment: Dev → Test → Prod

Once the full controller is in place, enterprises can deploy **development, testing, and production environments separately**.
Each environment runs isolated, but is managed through the **single Fabrix enterprise interface** for consistency.

This supports:

- Controlled promotion from Dev → Test → Prod
- Policy-as-code for environment governance
- Lifecycle upgrades and downgrades without downtime

## Application & Container Management

Fabrix extends beyond initial deployment by enabling ongoing container lifecycle management:

- Deploy and scale applications through the interface
- Roll back containers to known-good versions
- Apply updates consistently across environments
- Automate promotion of new versions with governance checks

This diagram shows the complete installation flow from initial deployment through to production environments, highlighting the progression from minimal bootstrap to full enterprise governance.

## Key Takeaway

Fabrix installation is **predictable, modular, and upgradeable**.
From a minimal bootstrap to a fully governed controller with Dev → Test → Prod environments, enterprises gain complete visibility and rollback options — all without manual reconfiguration.
