## Installation Options

Fabrix can be installed via the **Azure Marketplace** for a guided, baseline deployment. Enterprises may also choose manual installation for hybrid or custom environments.

All deployments are tenant-owned, with resources created in the customer's Azure subscription and secured through private networking and Key Vault.

## Infrastructure Sizing & Scaling

Fabrix offers infrastructure profiles sized **S, M, L, and XL**. Each size maps to workload complexity and expected user volume.

Scaling is supported through Azure-native services: autoscaling container workloads, multi-region distribution with Azure Front Door, and Dev → Test → Prod promotion for enterprise lifecycle management.

## Subscription Tiers

Fabrix is delivered as a subscription with tiers designed to fit different stages of adoption:

- **Community** — entry-level, single-environment, limited features.
- **Standard** — multi-environment support, governance packs, and enterprise connectors.
- **Enterprise** — full policy controls, advanced observability, SLAs, and multi-region scaling.

Azure infrastructure costs are billed directly to the customer, ensuring cost transparency.

## Support & SLAs

Enterprise subscriptions include access to support services and **service-level agreements**. Options range from best-effort support for community users to 24/7 enterprise-grade SLAs.

Operational visibility is provided through monitoring dashboards, logs, and health endpoints, ensuring proactive issue management.

## Exit Path & Open Foundation

Fabrix is built on an **open-source foundation**. Customers can continue independently on open components if a subscription ends.

This guarantees that enterprises avoid lock-in, protecting long-term investments in both infrastructure and AI workflows.

## Conclusion

Fabrix deployment and operations are predictable and enterprise-ready. With secure installation, clear scaling options, transparent billing, and an open exit path, Fabrix ensures organizations can adopt AI with confidence.
