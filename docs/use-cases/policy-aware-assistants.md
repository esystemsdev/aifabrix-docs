# Policy-Aware Assistants

AI Fabrix enables enterprises to move beyond generic chatbots by creating **assistants that enforce policies and governance at every step**.
These assistants are not just knowledge tools — they are **compliance-aware digital colleagues** that respect enterprise rules, access controls, and regulatory obligations.

## Key Capabilities

- **Policy Enforcement at Runtime**
  Every answer is checked against enterprise rules — including egress restrictions, redaction policies, and role-based limitations.

- **Contextual Governance**
  Assistants understand metadata such as project ID, confidentiality level, or customer classification, and apply policies dynamically.

- **Audit & Evidence Hooks**
  Every interaction is logged with traceability, creating audit-ready evidence for regulated processes.

- **Customizable Policy Packs**
  Administrators can define policies as code (via the Miso control layer) to enforce sector-specific rules — e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, or financial reporting standards.

## Enterprise Value

- **Reduce regulatory exposure**: Every assistant interaction inherits compliance policies.
- **Build trust in AI**: Employees and regulators know that AI responses are governed.
- **Enable sector-specific copilots**: Finance, healthcare, and public sector organizations can safely adopt AI without custom engineering.
- **Accelerate adoption**: Governance is built in, not bolted on.

## Example Use Cases

- **Healthcare**: An assistant that answers clinical documentation queries but automatically redacts patient identifiers.
- **Finance**: A reporting assistant that enforces segregation of duties and prevents access to restricted deal data.
- **Public Sector**: A citizen-service assistant that applies language and disclosure policies consistently.

Fabrix ensures **policies and metadata context are applied before the user receives an answer**, not after the fact.
