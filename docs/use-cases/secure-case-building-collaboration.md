# Secure Case Building & Collaboration

AI Fabrix turns conversational AI into a **compliance-ready workspace** for teams that need to collect, analyse, and share evidence securely.
Instead of scattering documents across email, chat, and folders, Fabrix provides a governed environment where **cases are built collaboratively with audit trails and access controls by default**.

## Key Capabilities

- **OpenWebUI Workspaces**
  Teams can collaborate in a shared space, attach evidence, and interact with AI while retaining compliance.

- **Evidence Management**
  Content from SharePoint, Teams, CRM, or ERP systems can be linked directly into a case, with metadata inheritance for traceability.

- **Audit Logging**
  Every action — from document retrieval to assistant response — is logged, creating an auditable chain of evidence.

- **Role-Based Access**
  Access is governed by Entra ID and SCIM provisioning, ensuring only authorised users can participate in case building.

## Enterprise Value

- **Support regulated workflows**: Audits, investigations, and legal reviews can be conducted within a secure AI-enabled workspace.
- **Strengthen compliance posture**: Evidence is collected and analysed without leaving governed environments.
- **Increase efficiency**: Teams avoid manual collation of documents, emails, and transcripts.
- **Improve trust**: Business stakeholders know outputs can stand up to compliance scrutiny.

## Example Use Cases

- **Internal Audit**: Collecting financial records and meeting transcripts into a case workspace with automatic audit logs.
- **Legal**: Building legal cases with cross-referenced evidence from SharePoint and CRM while ensuring confidentiality.
- **HR/Investigations**: Conducting workplace investigations where evidence integrity and access controls are critical.
