# Microsoft 365 Knowledge Retrieval

AI Fabrix transforms Microsoft 365 into a **secure, enterprise-wide knowledge fabric**.
By integrating natively with **SharePoint, Teams, and OneDrive**, Fabrix enables retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that respects **permissions, policies, and compliance requirements**.

Unlike generic copilots or external chatbots, Fabrix ensures that **users only see what they are entitled to** — no accidental data leaks, no shadow access.

## Key Capabilities

- **Permission-Aware Retrieval**
  Every query runs through Fabrix's metadata layer, enforcing SharePoint, Teams, and OneDrive permissions automatically.

- **Cross-Repository Knowledge Access**
  Connects distributed content across M365 — documents, chats, meeting transcripts — without breaking compliance rules.

- **Metadata Inheritance**
  Inherits folder and site metadata (e.g., deal name, project ID, classification labels) for more precise retrieval and filtering.

- **Policy Enforcement**
  Administrators can apply governance packs that limit egress, enforce retention rules, and ensure compliance with ISO-27001 or industry-specific standards.

## Enterprise Value

- **Reduce compliance risk**: All retrieval aligns with existing Microsoft 365 access controls.
- **Boost productivity**: Employees find the right documents faster, without switching tools.
- **Enable safe copilots**: Build internal knowledge assistants that scale without introducing SaaS data risks.
- **Improve ROI**: Leverage existing Microsoft investments instead of duplicating infrastructure.

## Example Use Cases

- Legal team searching across SharePoint sites for case material while preserving confidentiality.
- Customer service retrieving Teams meeting notes and OneDrive evidence tied to a support case.
- Project teams accessing distributed project files with enforced role-based visibility.

Fabrix ensures **retrieval is always filtered by permissions and metadata policies** before any LLM interaction.
