## Microsoft 365 Knowledge Retrieval

Fabrix integrates with SharePoint, Teams, and OneDrive to deliver **permission-aware retrieval**. Users only access the documents and messages they are entitled to, reducing compliance risks.

This allows organizations to create internal knowledge assistants that scale across departments while maintaining security and access integrity.

## Policy-Aware Assistants

Unlike generic chatbots, Fabrix enables the creation of **assistants with built-in policy enforcement**. These assistants apply enterprise rules to every interaction, ensuring outputs comply with governance, security, and regulatory standards.

They are particularly valuable in regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, and the public sector.

## Secure Case Building & Collaboration

OpenWebUI provides a space for teams to **build cases collaboratively**. Users can attach evidence from SharePoint, Teams, CRM, or ERP systems, while Fabrix enforces audit logging and access controls.

This turns conversational AI into a secure workspace for compliance-driven processes like investigations, audits, and legal reviews.

## Sales & Project Workspaces

Fabrix can support sales and delivery teams by creating **workspace assistants** linked to deals or projects. These workspaces aggregate documents, meeting transcripts, and evidence, making it easier to collaborate and prepare business cases.

Integration with CRM systems ensures that AI-powered insights are contextualized and policy-aware.

This diagram shows the contrast:

- **Generic chatbots** answer questions but lack governance, policy, or compliance guarantees.
- **Fabrix use cases** are structured, governed, and directly tied to enterprise processes.
