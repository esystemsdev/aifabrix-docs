# Competitive Comparison

Enterprises evaluating AI platforms often compare **SaaS AI tools, open-source frameworks, baseline Microsoft services, and AI Fabrix**. Each category has strengths, but also clear limitations. Fabrix fills the gaps by combining **in-tenant security, governance, observability, and predictable economics**.

## SaaS AI Tools

**Strengths:**

- Fast to start, minimal setup.
- Broad features and integrations for general use.

**Limitations:**

- **Data leaves your tenant** — SaaS providers process sensitive information externally.
- **Vendor lock-in** — migration away is complex and costly.
- Limited alignment with enterprise identity, governance, and compliance.
- Often unclear or variable cost models.

**Fit:** Best for lightweight use cases or non-sensitive experimentation, not for regulated enterprise adoption.

## Open-Source Only

**Strengths:**

- Full flexibility and no license restrictions.
- Large ecosystem of community connectors and tools.

**Limitations:**

- **No enterprise governance** — no policy packs, no SCIM provisioning, no RBAC inheritance.
- **Hidden costs** — compliance, integration, monitoring, and security controls must be built in-house.
- High ongoing maintenance burden on IT teams.
- No predictable support or SLAs.

**Fit:** Best for research labs or highly technical teams ready to invest in building governance themselves.

## Microsoft Baseline Services

**Strengths:**

- Strong foundation with **Azure OpenAI**, **Azure AI Search**, and **Microsoft 365 Graph APIs**.
- Seamless integration with the Microsoft ecosystem.

**Limitations:**

- **No metadata-aware retrieval** — permissions from SharePoint/Teams/CRM not automatically enforced.
- **No governance layer** — lacks policy packs, quotas, observability, and audit-by-default.
- Enterprises must build the orchestration, governance, and compliance layer themselves.

**Fit:** Essential foundation, but requires significant effort to make enterprise-ready.

## AI Fabrix

**Strengths:**

- **In-tenant by design** — runs inside your Azure subscription.
- **Metadata-aware retrieval** — permission-aware search across Microsoft 365 and business systems.
- **Miso governance layer** — Entra ID SSO, SCIM provisioning, policy packs, quotas, audit trails.
- **Predictable economics** — subscription tiers + direct Azure billing.
- **No lock-in** — open foundation with an exit path.

**Fit:** Best choice for enterprises needing **secure, governed, and production-ready AI at scale**.

## Key Takeaway

- **SaaS tools** are fast but risky for sensitive data.
- **Open source** is flexible but costly to secure and maintain.
- **Microsoft baseline** is a strong foundation but incomplete for enterprise AI governance.
- **AI Fabrix** brings all pieces together — governance, metadata, observability, and predictable economics — to make enterprise AI **safe, compliant, and scalable from day one**.
