# Pilot & Rollout Playbook

A successful AI adoption journey requires more than proving model accuracy. Enterprises must validate **infrastructure, compliance, and governance** before scaling to real business value. This playbook outlines how to move from proof-of-concept to full rollout with AI Fabrix.

## Step 1: Proof-of-Concept (30 Days)

- Deploy AI Fabrix inside your Azure tenant.
- Validate network isolation, Key Vault integration, and compliance guardrails.
- Connect Microsoft 365 (SharePoint/Teams) and one line-of-business system (e.g. CRM).
- Test metadata-aware retrieval with real documents.
- Confirm audit logging, identity, and policy enforcement.

**Outcome:** A secure, compliant foundation validated against IT standards.

## Step 2: Departmental Pilot

- Select one **department or use case** (e.g. sales case building, policy retrieval, compliance assistant).
- Run workflows with **real data** and a limited set of business users.
- Measure adoption, productivity, and compliance alignment.
- Establish KPIs: accuracy, speed, user satisfaction, cost telemetry.
- Gather feedback to refine governance policies and connectors.

**Outcome:** Demonstrated business value, aligned with IT guardrails, and backed by measurable results.

## Step 3: Enterprise Rollout

- Extend to multiple departments or domains with shared governance.
- Enable advanced features: SCIM provisioning, quotas, egress controls.
- Integrate more connectors (ERP, HR, finance, external data).
- Implement observability at scale: logs, metrics, traces, and cost dashboards.
- Establish production-ready processes for Dev → Test → Prod lifecycle.

**Outcome:** A governed, observable AI fabric running across the enterprise.

## Step 4: Continuous Improvement

- Use audit logs and usage telemetry to refine policies and quotas.
- Onboard new connectors and use cases through the **Miso governance layer**.
- Scale environments (S → M → L → XL) as adoption grows.
- Expand to multi-region deployments via Azure Front Door for global operations.

**Outcome:** AI Fabrix becomes a **long-term enterprise AI platform**, not just a pilot project.

## Key Takeaway

The rollout journey is **structured, safe, and predictable**:

1. Proof-of-concept validates the foundation.
2. Departmental pilot proves business value.
3. Enterprise rollout scales across domains with governance.
4. Continuous improvement drives sustained ROI.

With AI Fabrix, enterprises avoid the "pilot trap" and move confidently from experiment to **production-scale AI inside their Azure tenant**.
