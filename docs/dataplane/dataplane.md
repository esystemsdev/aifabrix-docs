# Dataplane

**Secure execution and enterprise data access**

The Dataplane is the execution boundary of AI Fabrix. It is the only layer allowed to access enterprise data, execute integrations, and process business payloads. All AI interactions, system integrations, and retrieval operations converge here under enforced identity, policy, and metadata controls.

The Dataplane exists to ensure that **governance, security, and permission-awareness are structural**, not implemented ad hoc in applications, workflows, or agents.

* **[Dataplane Overview](dataplane-overview.md)** — What the Dataplane is, execution boundary, security and isolation model
* **[CIP — Composable Integration Pipelines](cip-composable-integration-pipelines.md)** — Declarative pipelines, OpenAPI and MCP contracts, governed execution
* **[Core Dataplane Services](core-dataplane-services.md)** — Metadata model, permission-aware retrieval, vector search, CDC, ingestion, and secure runtime

**Key takeaway**: The Dataplane is where enterprise data becomes AI-ready — securely, governably, and inspectably. CIP and core services make this possible at scale.
