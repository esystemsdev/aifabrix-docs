# Flowise — Orchestration for RAG Pipelines & Agents

Flowise is the **orchestration layer** of AI Fabrix.
It allows enterprises to design, manage, and monitor **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and AI agents** — with full alignment to governance and compliance policies defined in Miso.

Flowise ensures that AI is not just experimental, but structured, auditable, and ready for production scaling.

## Role of Flowise

Flowise provides a **visual and programmable interface** to build AI-powered flows.
It connects:

- Data sources from Core Services.
- Azure OpenAI or other LLM endpoints.
- Policies and metadata filters from Miso.
- Custom plugins via the Fabrix SDK.

It is the **workflow brain** of Fabrix — ensuring AI tasks are transparent, consistent, and reproducible.

## Pipeline Orchestration

Flowise enables enterprises to design **retrieval pipelines** that:

- Ingest queries from users or systems.
- Retrieve context via metadata-aware search.
- Pass results to AI models (Azure OpenAI, OSS models, etc.).
- Apply governance filters and response shaping.

Pipelines can be versioned, tested, and deployed through Dev → Test → Prod lifecycles, ensuring **repeatability and compliance**.

## Agent Framework

Flowise includes an **agent orchestration system**:

- Agents can use tools such as connectors, APIs, or external actions.
- Each agent runs under governance (identity, permissions, audit).
- Agents are reusable across teams and business cases.

This allows enterprises to standardize "assistants" for domains like sales, legal, HR, or IT operations.

## Structured Outputs & Reuse

To avoid "black box" answers, Flowise supports:

- **Structured outputs** with schema validation (tables, JSON, forms).
- **Reusable building blocks** (retrieval nodes, enrichment steps, policy checks).
- **Composable flows** — enterprises can chain and reuse components across projects.

This reduces duplication and ensures consistent AI behaviors across departments.

## Governance & Observability

Flowise is tightly integrated with Miso:

- **Policy Enforcement:** All flows inherit quotas, egress rules, and access controls.
- **Audit Logging:** Every flow execution is logged with correlation IDs.
- **Cost Tracking:** Telemetry shows usage per pipeline or agent.
- **Health Monitoring:** Admins can view flow performance and errors in real time.

This transforms AI orchestration from **trial-and-error** into a **governed enterprise process**.

## Enterprise Benefits

With Flowise, enterprises gain:

- **Transparent Orchestration:** AI pipelines are visible and manageable.
- **Standardized Agents:** Consistent behaviors across use cases.
- **Governed Workflows:** Every step is policy-aware and auditable.
- **Faster Adoption:** Reusable building blocks accelerate deployment.
