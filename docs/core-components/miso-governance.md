# Miso — Governance & Deployment

Miso is the **governance and deployment control layer** of AI Fabrix.
It ensures that every part of the platform — from connectors to RAG pipelines — operates under enterprise-grade security, compliance, and lifecycle management.
This makes Miso the foundation that elevates Fabrix from "just open source" into a production-ready, auditable, and compliant enterprise platform.

## Role of Miso

Miso provides the **control plane** for Fabrix. It:

- Connects identity and access policies into the AI platform.
- Defines and enforces governance rules through policy packs.
- Manages the lifecycle of environments (Dev → Test → Prod).
- Ensures auditability and compliance across all workflows.

Without Miso, enterprises would face ungoverned AI experiments with inconsistent controls. With Miso, Fabrix deployments become predictable, standardized, and safe to scale.

## Identity & Access Integration

Miso integrates deeply with Microsoft Entra ID:

- **SSO & RBAC:** All access follows existing Entra ID roles and inheritance.
- **SCIM Provisioning:** Automated user and group provisioning.
- **Cross-Workspace Roles:** Supports multiple projects or departments with federated permissions.

This guarantees that AI assistants, pipelines, and plugins inherit the **same access policies as core IT systems**.

## Policy Packs & Governance

Miso provides pre-defined and customizable **policy packs**, covering:

- **Data Egress Control:** Prevents unauthorized external connections.
- **Quota Management:** Defines usage limits by user, group, or workspace.
- **Audit Hooks:** Standardized logs for evidence collection and compliance reporting.
- **Cost Controls:** Prevents unexpected cloud spend by enforcing resource thresholds.

Policies are centrally defined, versioned, and applied consistently across connectors, pipelines, and plugins.

## Lifecycle & Environment Management

Miso enforces **policy-as-code** for managing environments:

- **Dev → Test → Prod:** Clear promotion paths, ensuring governance rules are applied at each stage.
- **Blue/Green Deployments:** Safe upgrades with rollback options.
- **Configuration Drift Protection:** Ensures all environments stay aligned with approved policies.

This allows enterprises to innovate quickly while maintaining predictable operations.

## Security & Compliance Alignment

Miso aligns Fabrix with enterprise and regulatory requirements:

- **ISO-27001 Patterns:** Built-in security controls and processes.
- **Key Vault–Only Secrets:** No unmanaged secrets in code or containers.
- **Audit Trails:** Complete traceability of actions and policy changes.
- **SBOM & Image Signing:** Ensures software provenance and supply chain integrity.

By design, Miso helps organizations prove compliance for GDPR, HIPAA, and other frameworks.

## Benefits for the Enterprise

With Miso in place, enterprises gain:

- **Predictable Deployments:** Consistency across all environments.
- **Controlled Growth:** Safe scaling without uncontrolled sprawl.
- **Audit-Ready Operations:** Every action logged and traceable.
- **Integrated Security:** Identity, policy, and infrastructure governance unified.

Miso is what makes Fabrix not just *deployable*, but **enterprise-deployable**.
