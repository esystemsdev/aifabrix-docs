# OpenWebUI — Secure UX for Chat & Case Building

OpenWebUI is the **user interface layer** of AI Fabrix.
It provides a secure, enterprise-ready workspace for employees to interact with AI — whether through chat, case building, or collaborative knowledge work.
Unlike consumer-grade chat tools, OpenWebUI is identity-aware, policy-enforced, and auditable by design.

## Role of OpenWebUI

OpenWebUI is the **front door for users** into Fabrix.
It connects employees to:

- Policy-aware retrieval pipelines.
- AI assistants and agents orchestrated via Flowise.
- Business case workspaces and collaboration tools.

All interactions are governed by the policies and identity integrations provided by Miso.

## Enterprise Chat Experience

OpenWebUI provides a **secure chat interface** where users can:

- Ask questions across enterprise knowledge bases.
- Receive responses filtered by metadata, permissions, and compliance rules.
- Interact with AI agents designed for specific business domains (e.g., sales, HR, IT).

Unlike public chatbots, Fabrix ensures that **users only see what they are authorized to see**.

## Case Building & Collaboration

Beyond chat, OpenWebUI supports **case building**:

- Users can collect conversations, documents, and evidence into structured cases.
- Cases can be shared across departments for cross-functional work.
- Links to CRM records, SharePoint folders, and project metadata are preserved.

This makes Fabrix suitable for **regulated industries** where traceability and evidence matter (e.g., legal, compliance, project delivery).

## Integration with Microsoft 365

OpenWebUI complements Microsoft's collaboration tools:

- **SharePoint & Teams:** Results and evidence link directly back to Microsoft 365 content.
- **Entra ID:** Access follows existing user roles and permissions.
- **Azure Monitor & Sentinel:** Audit and security logs integrate with Microsoft monitoring.

This ensures Fabrix feels like a **natural extension of Microsoft 365**, not a competing platform.

## Security & Compliance Features

OpenWebUI is designed for enterprise trust:

- **SSO via Entra ID** — no separate accounts.
- **Audit Logging** — every query and case action is traceable.
- **Policy Enforcement** — egress, quotas, and permissions inherited from Miso.
- **Data Residency** — all operations remain inside the customer's Azure tenant.

These controls make it viable for GDPR, HIPAA, ISO-27001, and similar frameworks.

## Enterprise Benefits

With OpenWebUI, organizations gain:

- **Secure Chat for Enterprise Knowledge.**
- **Structured Case Management.**
- **Deep Microsoft 365 Integration.**
- **Audit-Ready Collaboration.**

It transforms AI from an **isolated chatbot** into a **collaborative enterprise assistant** that fits regulated business processes.
