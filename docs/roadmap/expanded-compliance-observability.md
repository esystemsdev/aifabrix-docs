## Compliance by Design

Future Fabrix updates will focus on strengthening compliance alignment with enterprise and industry standards:

- **Automated Evidence Generation:** Pre-built reports for ISO-27001, SOC 2, GDPR, and industry-specific requirements.
- **Policy-as-Code Expansion:** Promote Dev → Test → Prod environments with compliance guardrails enforced by automation.
- **SBOM Extensions:** Deeper supply chain reporting, ensuring every container and dependency is verifiable.
- **Integration with Audit Platforms:** Direct export of logs and compliance artifacts into GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) tools.

## Observability Enhancements

To support production-scale deployments, Fabrix will expand its observability capabilities across logs, metrics, and traces:

- **Unified Dashboards:** Centralized visibility for system health, workloads, and cost drivers.
- **Correlation IDs:** End-to-end traceability across connectors, pipelines, and user interactions.
- **Proactive Alerts:** Threshold-based alerts for performance, usage, or policy violations.
- **SIEM & Monitoring Integration:** Native integration with Microsoft Sentinel, Splunk, and other monitoring platforms.

## Cost & Economics Transparency

Predictable economics remain a key design principle. Upcoming improvements include:

- **Cost Forecasting Tools:** Forward-looking estimates based on Azure billing and usage patterns.
- **Quota Visualization:** Clear dashboards showing token, embedding, and API usage against policy limits.
- **Environment Cost Comparison:** Visibility into Dev, Test, and Production cost differentials.
