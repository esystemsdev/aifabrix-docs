## Strategic Direction

Fabrix development is guided by four core enterprise drivers:

- **In-Tenant First** – keep deployments secure and private by default.
- **Governance & Policy Control** – extend policy packs, audits, and usage guardrails.
- **Enterprise Integration** – broaden connectors and SDK capabilities for business systems.
- **Predictable Economics** – provide cost forecasting and scalable subscription tiers.

This ensures Fabrix continues to serve as a **trusted AI foundation** inside Microsoft Azure, while steadily expanding reach and functionality.
