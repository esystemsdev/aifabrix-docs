# 10. Resources — Overview

The **Resources** section provides the supporting material enterprises need to successfully evaluate, deploy, and operate **AI Fabrix**.
While the core documentation explains the *what* and *why*, these resources focus on the *how* — delivering templates, diagrams, and starter kits that accelerate adoption without compromising governance or compliance.

## Table of Contents

## Why Resources Matter

Enterprises adopting AI platforms often face three challenges:

1. **Complex evaluation cycles** — CIOs and architects require structured tools to compare vendors and assess compliance.
2. **Deployment clarity** — IT teams need reference architectures and sizing guides to align with Azure best practices.
3. **Developer enablement** — Extending Fabrix with connectors or plugins requires secure, well-documented starting points.

The resources in this section address all three, ensuring Fabrix deployments move quickly from **pilot to production** with full enterprise guardrails.
