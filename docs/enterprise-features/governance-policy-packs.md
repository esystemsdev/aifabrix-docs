# Governance & Policy Packs

AI Fabrix embeds **governance by design**. Instead of treating governance as an afterthought, Fabrix uses its **Miso control layer** to enforce consistent policies across every connector, pipeline, and workspace. This ensures that AI adoption remains safe, transparent, and predictable—even at enterprise scale.

## Policy Packs

- **Predefined Controls:** Fabrix ships with policy packs for common governance needs, such as egress restrictions, usage quotas, and connector access.
- **Custom Policies:** Administrators can define custom rules aligned with internal compliance frameworks or regulatory mandates.
- **Policy-as-Code:** Policies can be versioned and promoted across Dev → Test → Prod environments, ensuring consistency without manual oversight.

## Usage & Cost Guardrails

- **Quotas:** Limit tokens, storage, or API calls to prevent runaway costs.
- **Budgets:** Set workspace-level cost thresholds to align with project budgets.
- **Cost Forecasting:** Usage telemetry feeds into cost projections, helping enterprises stay within financial limits.

## Egress & Data Controls

- **Egress Restrictions:** Policies control what external systems Fabrix can connect to, reducing data exfiltration risk.
- **Connector Governance:** Each connector inherits governance checks before being deployed in production.
- **Evidence Hooks:** Every policy decision is logged, creating transparent proof of enforcement.

## Auditable Governance

- **Centralized Logs:** All governance actions (e.g., quota enforcement, connector approvals) are logged with correlation IDs.
- **Traceable Enforcement:** Administrators can show when and how policies were applied.
- **Audit-Ready Evidence:** Logs are exportable to SIEM and compliance systems for regulatory audits.

## Benefits

Fabrix governance ensures:

- No "shadow AI" pipelines escape enterprise policy.
- Administrators can balance innovation with compliance.
- Enterprises retain **predictable control over risk and cost**.

## Conclusion

With governance and policy packs, Fabrix ensures that **AI is never a free-for-all**. Every connector, workflow, and user action is controlled, auditable, and compliant with enterprise rules—**from pilot to global rollout**.
