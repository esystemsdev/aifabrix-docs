## Compliance-by-Design

- **ISO-27001 Alignment:** Fabrix follows secure development and operational practices consistent with ISO-27001 controls.
- **Azure-Native Security:** All secrets are stored in **Azure Key Vault**, and workloads run on hardened containers inside the customer's tenant.
- **Private Networking:** Services communicate only through private endpoints, with no unmanaged public exposure.
- **Secure Baseline:** Deployment templates follow Microsoft's Azure security benchmarks, reducing audit overhead.

## Audit Trails

- **User Actions:** Every login, role assignment, and workflow execution is captured with time-stamped logs.
- **Connector Usage:** All data movement (e.g., SharePoint sync, CRM ingestion) is logged with context and correlation IDs.
- **AI Outputs:** Responses generated by agents can be linked to source documents and metadata for traceability.

## Evidence & Reporting

- **Exportable Logs:** Fabrix integrates with SIEM tools for long-term storage and regulatory reporting.
- **Correlation IDs:** Each workflow run carries a unique trace identifier to simplify root-cause analysis and compliance review.
- **SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials):** Fabrix components are shipped with SBOMs to support software supply chain transparency.

## Benefits

With Fabrix, enterprises gain:

- Confidence that **security and compliance are enforced by default**, not added later.
- Transparent, auditable evidence trails for every user, connector, and AI output.
- Reduced risk of compliance violations when scaling AI into sensitive use cases.

## Conclusion

Fabrix provides more than technical complianceâ€”it creates an **evidence-ready AI fabric** that supports regulatory audits, risk management, and board-level assurance. Enterprises can prove, not just claim, that AI adoption is **secure, governed, and compliant**.
